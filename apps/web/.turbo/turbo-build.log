 ⚠ Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of /Users/philippbriese/package-lock.json as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `turbopack.root` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack#root-directory for more information.
 Detected additional lockfiles:
